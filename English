I have just returned from a visit to my landlord the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with.
He soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse.
Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two it was not injudicious.
Only the lonely can understand the pain of solitude.
Many ways are the right ways.
Is there a reason why you behaved so imprudently?
Beware! I can chase you to hell if I decide to. And you won't be safe anywhere.
